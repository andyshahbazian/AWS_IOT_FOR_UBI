# Use Based Insurance(UBI) telematics with AWS IotCore, Greengrass, timestream and managed Grafana.  

UBI is going to revolutionize insurance companies across the globe - in this Demo for AWS TFC - I will be building a telematic unit based on RM Cortex-A72 processor, a short explanation about UBI: in the past insurance companies based their underwriting business on the auto declaration, where insurance holders can pay for how much liability they introduce, and it is highly customizable -. So each of the packages   would consist of approximate mileage per year – where the car is parked and in which area of  the town, the purpose of driving for leisure or commute to work, make and model of the car and types of coverage they need to have, for example, uninsured motorist or third party. Insurance companies trust the driver on declared info but has to account or buffer for some room to tolerate inaccuracies in reports done by the driver (such as mileage and reports from DMV for violations) which spikes up the cosr for everybody, 
Insurance compay on-prem data center basically holds the various Compliance articles of each coverage based on where the insurance was issued. 
However, since Covid customer's driving patterns have changed, and they want a more tailored package to their needs, there are also a few new insurance companies like metro-mile, which started to offer advanced  UBI packages using telematics technology - telematics stands for extracting car data related to driver's and car safety and sending it to the insurance company for just in time  analysis.
